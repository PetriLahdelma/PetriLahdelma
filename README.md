## 👋 Hi, I’m Petri Lahdelma

I’m a design-systems-focused builder working at the intersection of **frontend engineering**, **AI-assisted workflows**, and **scalable SaaS**. With nearly **20 years of experience** across graphic design, UX, and product development, I specialize in turning messy, evolving requirements into **resilient systems that are pleasant to build on**.

### What I work on
- **Design systems at scale**  
  I currently lead design system work at **SAP Build Apps**, focusing on production-grade components, design-to-code alignment, and long-term DesignOps maturity. My day-to-day sits somewhere between Figma, Storybook, React, and the uncomfortable but necessary conversations about governance and consistency.

- **AI-powered SaaS & automation**  
  I’m the founder of **VertaaUX.ai**, an AI-powered UX and accessibility auditing platform built with an API-first mindset. The product explores async pipelines, LLM-assisted analysis, CI-friendly workflows, and pragmatic guardrails around correctness, security, and cost.

- **Open source & developer experience**  
  I’m deeply interested in how tools are *actually* used by developers: clear APIs, boring reliability, observable systems, and documentation that doesn’t lie. I enjoy experimenting with open source, MCPs, AI coding agents, and modern frontend architectures to see where the real leverage is (and where the hype breaks).

### How I think
- Systems > pixels  
- Deterministic foundations + probabilistic AI on top  
- PLG beats decks, but fundamentals beat both  
- “Simple” is usually the hardest thing to ship

### 🛠️ Things I enjoy nerding out about
`Design Systems` · `React / TypeScript` · `Storybook` · `Next.js` · `AI & LLM tooling` ·  
`APIs & async pipelines` · `Developer experience` · `Observability` · `DesignOps` ·  
`SaaS unit economics` · `Shipping > theorizing`

### Besides design and code
I also make music, experiment visually, and enjoy exploring the creative edges where structure meets chaos. I’m trying to be as outdoorsy as possible, curious by default, but happiest when building something that didn’t exist yesterday.

*If you’re interested in design systems, AI-powered tooling, or the unglamorous realities of building products that last, you’ll probably get along with me just fine.*
